## Step 0 - Start with THE QUESTION(s).
### What is the problem you want to solve?
### What is the trend you want to highlight?
### What are the insights you look to uncover?

## Step 1 - Create a Jupyter Notebook #1, explaining how you are GETTING THE DATA TOGETHER:
* Describe the data exploration and cleanup process.
* Use Pandas to clean and format all dataset(s). 
* Use PyViz, GeoViews, and Hvplot to create six to eight data visualizations (ideally, at least two per question * asked of the data).
* Use one new Python library that hasn’t been covered in class.
* Save PNG images of the visualizations you find relevant to answer THE QUESTION.
* Optional: Use one API to get your data, if at all possible.

## Step 2 - Create a Jupyter Notebook #2, which details your DATA ANALYSIS. This is where you’re providing the answers to THE QUESTION above.
* dive deep into your analysis.
* confirm or infirm your hypotheses.
* deliver your conclusions.


Provide a short description of what you found and any relevant plots under each heading.
